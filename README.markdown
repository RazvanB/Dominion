# Dominion #

This is a C# implementation of [Dominion](http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=278), a board/card game.

Be aware that the web client isn't very usable after cloning the repository because I do not distribute the card images.

P.S Yes I know I am doing some truly heinous things in the code base. I'm taking lots of shortcuts with the implementation in some areas so I can focus on others.
